## üß™ Models Used

1. **Custom CNN**  
   A simple CNN model built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras.

2. **VGG16**  
   Transfer learning using the pre-trained VGG16 model, fine-tuned for our dataset.

3. **ResNet10**  
   A light-weight ResNet-based model customized for fast and efficient training.
